I have been interested in golang. Here are a couple of resources. Will keep updated the list.

### IDE/Editors
* [vim-golang-ide](http://farazdagi.com/blog/2015/vim-as-golang-ide). This plugin is pretty amazing.

### Books:
* [Simple intro golang book](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro). You could finish this in 30 mins.
* [Networking book](https://jannewmarch.gitbooks.io/network-programming-with-go-golang-/content/)
