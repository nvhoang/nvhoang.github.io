## About

I am a geek interested in pretty much anything related to computers. 

* I came from the country where Internet was extremely limited back then so most of the stuff I learned was through self-learning. 
* I first touched a computer when I was 15. It was a 386. I was hooked since then.
* My parent paid nearly a thousand bucks for my first computer (a 486 DX). I was exteremely grateful. I spent almost 12 hours a day on it.
* I wrote my first AI chess program in Pascal after a few months I had my computer. It managed to beat my friend in one game that he later disclaimed that he was drunk :-).
* My first time discovered event-based programming by myself was super exciting. Remember back then Pascal didn't have any notion of multithreading.
So I pretty much had to multiplex routines in a single-threaded program. I wrote a bunch of multi-player games like Tetris, Bomberman.
* I hacked into the intranet of my highschool and droppped a keylogger there. I just wanted to hide my games in the server hard disk :D. It was later discovered by
the admin and he was super pissed. Nothing happened though.
* I wrote my first Virus in Assembly when I was 16. I learned this through a book that my friend's relative brought from overseas. 
The virus hides itself in MS-DOS EXE and gets replicated whenever that file is executed. It occasionally erases a few letters in the text screen.
* I wrote the entire bulletin board program for my HS class in raw Javascript with no fancy AJAX or libs.
* My HS was also the place where I hooked up with algorithms.
* I worked part-time for a startup when I was in college. I was responsible for anti-crack module in their software. That was when I learned IDA and stuff.
* College went fast with a lot of projects. I was very interested in network programming. We wrote a aircraft shooting games that can be played over intranet.
* US was the place that made me realize all that I self-learned in the past was pretty much standard :-). There was a lot more exicting stuff out there. Ph.D. went fast, mostly academic stuff (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U9Ekj6cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I learned a lot.
* I landed a job at Google in 2010 working on G+ (before it was launched), then to YouTube ASR team and Google Docs in Sydney.
* I joined Tetration (a security startup later aquired by Cisco) in 2015 till 2021.
* I am now at Netflix working on some exiciting projects in Big Data Platform.
